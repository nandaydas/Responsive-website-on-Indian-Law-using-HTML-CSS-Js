            <h2>About-us</h2>
            Law in India primarily evolved from customary practices and religious prescription to the modern well
            codified acts
            and laws based on a constitution. This website basically shares some general information Indian Law System
            with
            specifications.
            <P> An Internship Project was alloted to our group consisting of 5 students where we had to create this
                website
                based on Indian Law Information System. This website is not a professional website yet we have tried to
                put the
                basic information about the subject and we have tried to add some designs and styles by using cascading
                style
                sheet to make the website look prominent. </P>
            <P>This website states the function of each laws or articles of the constitution from article 1 to article
                100. Each
                article describes its presence and its work. We hope this website may set up the glimpse of a basic idea
                about
                Indian Law System.</P>
            <P>We have created this website by using VS code application. In this website, we have placed the navigation
                bar,
                added
                different sections which provides lots of information relating the subject, lastly added a footer. The
                Home page
                has been designed gently by giving it a general look. Two to three pages are added to this website which
                shares
                the information about the subject. </P>
            <P>We the team of Group number 6 have created this website under the guidance of Sir Saroj Kumar Nandi,
                Proffessor
                of Icfai University. Myself Sneha Gope and my team mates- Nanday Das, Diptanu Debnath, Rituparna Sen
                were
                constantly working on this website to present it successfully. For sure there were some other students
                in my
                group or team but unfortunately they did not responded well any of the day.</P>

            We are grateful to Icfai University for letting us to work on this project as we have gathered much
            informations
            about Indian Law System and have known how to work on a project creating a website. We would like to work on
            further
            projects in the future which will be given by Icfai University.
